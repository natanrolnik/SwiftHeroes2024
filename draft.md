Since Swift's launch, many things happened to the language allowing it to leave the Apple's garden. The open sourcing of the language, the introduction of the Swift Package Manager, being able to compile on Linux and Windows, VS Code support, and the introduction of async-await, all contributed to be a great choice for writing server side applications, and also a perfect candidate for writing scripts and tools for increasing your and your team's productivity. 

You'll learn how to:

* run a single Swift script
* add dependencies to it using [swift-sh](https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh)
* run it using GitHub Actions
* make a new tool using the Swift Argument Parser
* read user input from the command line
* prepare a tool that does code generation
* write serverless functions and deploy to AWS Lambda & Vercel
* write a tiny server in Vapor that interacts with AWS S3

This will be an interactive talk, with live examples and demos, which the public will help choosing parts of it as it happens.

The goal of this talk is not to show that Swift is the perfect language for everything. But although Swift is not a silver bullet, it is the best language for tools that a team of iOS developers can maintain. The ecosystem is evolving in ways that support tooling as never before - the argument parser, async/await, Linux - and being able to write your own tools is an empowering skill for developers, which can really make the everyday of their colleagues smoother with faster workflows and less manual work.

The talk will aim to use some tools for the talk itself, such as allowing the crowd to choose in real time which live demo of the subjects they're more interested in.
